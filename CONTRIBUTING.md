## What to Contribute

Take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/cfilipov/MuscleBook/labels/help%20wanted) to see if there's anything you can help with. Contributions don't have to be limited to what's in the issues, but if you don't know where to start this should give you an idea.

## Non-Technical Contributions

Don't shy away from contributing just because you can't program. In fact, I believe the most valuable contributions at this point are non-technical in nature. There's more to this project than just code. Here is a list of at least a few non-technical areas where contributions are highly welcome (also have a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/cfilipov/MuscleBook/labels/help%20wanted) page):

* Iconography
* Exercise illustrations
* Exercises (copy, accuracy verification, metadata)
* Documentation (README file, instructions, help info)
* Corrections (is an exercise improperly defined? Spelling error in the UI? Did I get the math wrong somewhere?)
* Math (lots of calculations everywhere, suggest new ones or identify areas where the math is done incorrectly)
* Exercise Science   
	* Share research papers that might be relevant to the app. Point out areas that might go against established research.
* UX and design advice

[MuscleBook.net](http://musclebook.net) is a web app for analyzing and logging strength training and body building data. MuscleBook has no server and works completely offline using IndexedDB.

- Exercise search
- Github-style punchcard graph

## Non-Goals

Muscle Book aims to be a useful tool for all lifters regardless of routine, lifting style or goal. To that end, here is a list of functionality that is intentionally excluded from the scope of the project:

1. Workout planning
2. Suggestions or coaching
3. Routine-specific features
4. Anything that requires a centralized server
5. Non-strength or muscle related features (running, etc...)
6. Weight/exercise Goals

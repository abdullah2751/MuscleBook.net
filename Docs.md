## Metrics

There are two metrics that Muscle Book uses to measure workout performance: intensity and volume. There is a third metric available to you: duration, but this is less relevant for measuring performance (a long workout isn't necessarily a good workout). 

Typically you aim to have high volume **or** high intensity, not both.
You could shoot for both high intensity and volume but that's usually counterproductive, one of those metrics will may suffer as a result.
You can achieve high volume with low intensity by lifting many reps and/or sets at a lower weight. Conversely, you can achieve high intensity with low volume by lifting fewer sets of fewer reps at a higher weight. 

### Intensity

Intensity is the percentage of your maximum weight for a particular exercise. If your best overhead press is 120lbs and you lift 60lbs, then your intensity is 50%. Because intensity is relative to past data, lifting the same weight on two different day may result in different intensities. For example: if last month your max overhead press was 120lbs and you lifted 60lbs that was 50% intensity. But last week you hit a new record, lifting 125lbs. From that day forward, whenever you lift 60lbs, that will count as 48% intensity, but the intensity of all the days before that remain unaffected.

For exercises that are primarily measured in duration (ie. planks): the intensity is calculated as the percent of the max time up to that workout. For example, if your best record for planks is 1 min, and you perform a plank for 1 min and 20 seconds, then your intensity will be 130%.

### Volume

Volume is simply the total weight moved. If you deadlift 200lbs 5 times, the volume will be 1000lbs. If you performed 5 sets at that weight and rep range then your volume will be 5000lbs. 

For exercises that are primarily measured in duration (ie. planks): volume is calculated as the total time during that workout. For example: If you held a 1 minute plank for 3 sets, the duration will be 3 minutes.

### Duration

Any exercise can also have a duration recorded with it, even if it's not the primary measurement. While the duration overall isn't a great metric for tracking your performance, it can be helpful to understand other aspects of your workout, such as how much time are you resting between sets. If you notice your other metrics aren't doing well, it might be worth looking at whether or not your are resting enough.

## Visualizations

### Calendar Graph

The calendar graph provides a long-term view of workout consistency and progress by emphasizing [progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload). 
Streaks of high activity and periods of inactivity become clearly visible at a glance. Progress comes in months and years, not days and weeks. It's easy to become inconsistent with your lifting schedule, this graph shows you the long-term results of your dedication. It's hard to ignore the fact that you skipped the gym for three weeks in a row when it shows up as a giant empty spot on your calendar graph. 

The calendar graph tracks the intensity, volume and/or duration metrics on a per-day basis. 
The magnitude of each square is relative to the data that precedes it, filling a square to maximum darkness requires greater effort as time goes on. 
In other words: if a 200 lbs deadlift results in a max dark red square today, the same weight will result in a lighter square from that point on.
The same is true for volume as well.
The calendar graph will use the relative volume to determine how dark the square should be. So if you lifted 10,000lbs today, tomorrow you will have to lift something greater than 10,000lbs to get the precious dark square again.
Max darkness can be achieved by beating your best weight or beating your best volume. You don't need to hit PRs on every workout, but if you go a long time without a dark red square in at least on of these metrics then you might not be working out hard enough.
Because intensity of different ex

You might be thinking... you can just game the system by adding 1lbs to every workout. But this is actually the point, and exactly what Muscle Book tries to encourage with the way it displays the data. Adding 1lbs is barely noticeable, so you'll likely be able to lift it no problem, but you *are* still increasing your weight, and eventually that 1 pound will add up over time. You will also quickly realize that this will only work for so long, and you'll have to start trying more advanced routines where you back off and increase again.
